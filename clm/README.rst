Building and Running CLM Unit Tests
===================================

Before you write your own unit tests, you should make sure that you can build
and run the existing tests.

Here we document two ways to do this:

* On yellowstone - easiest, but slower to build and run the tests

* On your personal desktop / laptop - takes more one-time setup work on your
part, but once it is set up, this will let you build and run the unit tests much
faster. This also facilitates doing code development on your personal machine,
rather than remotely.
